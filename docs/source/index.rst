   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Cabinet's documentation!
===================================

This package is for a bunch of code that we frequently replicate here
at IPOP and to provide programmatic access to tools developed such as 
the REST API, and MetaMap without needed to install a bunch of dependencies.

This site is for documenting the functions themselves and how to use them. It will be
technical and detailed, not a tutorial. For a more general overview of the package, see
the README.

For more information, see the `GitHub README <https://github.com/UK-IPOP/cabinet>`_.
