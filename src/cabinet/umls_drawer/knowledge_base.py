"""This module contains the knowledge base class.


Currently it simply loads the concept conversion map and SNOMED tree from disk
and provides a few functions to access them.

In the future, we want to support tree traversal specifically. This will
allow us to get paths to the root, paths to any given terminal node, and paths 
to common ancestors/children. We can do this in a recursive way, but the exact 
implementation is still undecided for how to best handle the interface. 

We also want to support "prettifying" these paths using string formatting such as 
'/' or '->'. This will allow us to get paths like 'A/B/C' or 'A->B->C' instead of
['A', 'B', 'C'].
